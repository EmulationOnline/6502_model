# Failing Traces

This directory contains traces and their corresponding programs,
which have been observed to fail when run against the model.

You can add traces to this directory before updating the model. This
two-stage process also makes it convenient to collaborate with others.

Those that wish to focus on finding bugs and writing programs that demonstrate
those bugs can add traces here. Those that wish to focus on updating the model
can find failing traces here.

See also /passing_traces/README.md for a description of the trace format.
